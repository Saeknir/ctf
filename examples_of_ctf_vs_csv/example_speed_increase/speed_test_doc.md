## Goal
This test should be able to compare the average speed of CTF read vs CSV read based on how many columns are being accessed. It should run n times, n being the total number of columns in the file. It should start with checking the time to access a single column, then the next run should check two column, increasing until the last run checks all columns. It should have a configurable function that can be passed in that will be used on the data, this needs to be very similar but not the same for CTF and CSV. This can help normalize the extra time used to convert data types in CTF that isn't used in CSV.
