Description:
    Column Text Format (CTF) stores the columns of tabular data in plain text, combining performance with simplicity.
    CTF is a general purpose data storage format like CSV, but faster when loading a subset of the columns, because it's a column store.
    The storage itself consists of two components: plain text files for each column in a table or data frame, and a metadata file describing the data.
    The metadata file contains information required for fast, accurate data loading, such as the type of each column, and the number of rows.
    This package provides functions to read and write CTF data from R.
