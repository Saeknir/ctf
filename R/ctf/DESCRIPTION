Description:
    Columnar storage formats allow faster, more efficient access to data, and column text format (CTF) is a columnar storage format.
    The goal of CTF is simplicity: each column in a data frame corresponds to a file of plain text, and there's a metadata file.
    That's it.
    Use this lightweight package to read and write CTF from R.
