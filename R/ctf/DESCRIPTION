Description:
    Column Text Format (CTF) combines the efficiency of columnar storage with the simplicity of plain text.
    CTF consists of two components: a plain text file for each column in a table or data frame, and a metadata file describing the data.
    The metadata file contains information required for fast, accurate data loading, such as the type of each column, and the number of rows.
    This package provides functions to read and write CTF from R.
